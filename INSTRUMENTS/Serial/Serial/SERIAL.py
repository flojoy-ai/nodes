def SERIAL(v, params):
    """
    Node to take simple time dependent 1d data from an Ardunio,
    or a similar serial device.
    For example you can record temperature following this tutorial:

    https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor

    with Serial.println(steinhart) as the only line printing.

    It is important that the last line Arduino is returning is the
    data with a new line at the end (i.e. println()).

    The other lines must be returned with print()
    with print(",") between each line.

    For example:

    print(reading0)
    print(",")
    println(reading1)

    If there is more than one column, the SELECT_ARRAY node must be
    used after this node.

    params:
    num_readings: Number of points to record.
    record_period: Length between two recordings in seconds.
    BAUD_RATE: Baud rate for the serial device.
    com_port: COM port of the serial device

    num_readings * record_period is roughly the run length in seconds.
