This example app uses the JSON_EXTRACTOR node for extracting estructured data (as JSON) from unstructured text.
In this example we are trying to extract 2 properties (price and name) from the following text:
**Headset Gamer Bluetooth MJ23 - $100**
The properties and text are defined in the node's form.
