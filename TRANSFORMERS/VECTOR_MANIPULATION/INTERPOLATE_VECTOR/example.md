In this example, we generate a vector by using a `LINSPACE` node. Then the difference between elements located at index 6 and 7 is after interpolation point is calculated by `INTERPOLATE_VECTOR` as the fractional index of 6.12321 is passed as its parameter. 13 respectively using `REPLACE_SUBSET`. The interpolation value is then computed by adding the product of the difference between two elements and the fraction value to the element located at interpolation point. The result is visualized with `BIG_NUMBER` node.
