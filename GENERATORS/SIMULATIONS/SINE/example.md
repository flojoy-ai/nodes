In this example, the `LINSPACE` and `SINE` nodes generate a sine function which is visualized with the `SCATTER` node.

For the `LINSPACE` node, we want the sine function to be 10 seconds long, so the `start` parameter will be 0 with `end` being 10.
The `step` parameter in this case is 1000, which is also the total number of samples.

For the `SINE` node, in this example, a sine wave with an amplitude of 3 and a frequency of 1Hz is generated, which are the parameters.
