    """The BASIC_OSCILLATOR node is a combination of LINSPACE and SINE node.
    It offers a more straight forward way of generating signals, with
    sample rate and the time in seconds as parameters, along with all the parameters
    in the SINE node.
    This node is particularly useful with signal processing applications as the sample rate is commonly used.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_rate: float
        How many samples taken during a second
    time: float
        The total amount of time of the signal
    waveform: select
    amplitude: float
    frequency: float
    offset: float
    phase: float

    Returns

        y: generated signal
