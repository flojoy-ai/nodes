In this example : 

- The ['CAMERA'](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/INSTRUMENTS/WEB_CAM/CAMERA/CAMERA.py) node takes and returns a picture if a USB camera is connected to the computer.

- The ['IMSHOW'](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/VISUALIZERS/PLOTLY/TABLE/TABLE.py) node displays the image taken by the camera.


- The ['END'](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/TERMINATORS/END/END.py) node terminates the process.
