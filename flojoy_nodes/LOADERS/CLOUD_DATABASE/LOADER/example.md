The workflow of this app is described below:

`43`[CONSTANT](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py) : This is a CONSTANT node with a value of 43. It passing a DataContainer class of an ordered pair (x, y pair) to the next node `LOOP`, where x is None and y is a NumPy array with a value of 43.

[LOOP](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py): This node is a special type that iterating through all the nodes connected to the body output a specified number of times as defined by its parameter `num_loop`, in this case this set to 2. It passes the value of the previous `CONSTANT` node to the next nodes.

`12`[CONSTANT](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py): This is another `CONSTANT` node which value is 12. It passing the value of the previous node's output in the 'x' key and its own output in the 'y' key. e.g: `{'x': <output of previous node>, 'y': [12,12,....]}`

`-1`[CONSTANT](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py): Another `CONSTANT` node with a negative value of `-1`, performing the same function as the other CONSTANT nodes.

[FEEDBACK](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/FEEDBACK/FEEDBACK.py): This is another special node that fetching the output of the given node ID in it's parameter `referred_node` in this case it's `ADD` node `"ADD-0758c6a8-52b4-4b5b-9c46-2a83bdef2a04"`, on first iteration it passing the output of previous node and  eventually the output of `ADD` node's output. 

[ADD](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/TRANSFORMERS/ARITHMETIC/ADD/ADD.py): Adding the value of connected inputs, in this case `CONSTANT` `-1` and output of `FEEDBACK` node.

[LOADER](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOADERS/CLOUD_DATABASE/LOADER/LOADER.py): This node imports `FRONTIER_API_KEY` from `~/.flojoy/credentials` file and takes a parameter called `measurement_uuid`, which is the user measurement UUID of Frontier account. Using the `FRONTIER_API_KEY` and `measurement_uuid` sends input measurements to Frontier API on every run. This will throw an error if any of these two keys are not found.

[GOTO](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/GOTO/GOTO.py): This node refering to the `LOOP` node to check if the specified number of iteration is completed.

[TERMINATE](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/TERMINATORS/END/END.py): This node terminating the current script run. The output of this node is same as its parent node.
