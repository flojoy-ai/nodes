This example shows a simple way to create a loop with Flojoy.
First, you'll need to place these three nodes:

- The [`LINSPACE`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/LINSPACE/LINSPACE.py) node which will genearte evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. This node is needed to pass value to LOOP node as it requires a input node.

- The [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node which will define the number of loops.

- The [`TABLE`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/VISUALIZERS/PLOTLY/TABLE/TABLE.py) node which is connected with end output of the loop node.

After that, we can place nodes to generate and visualize data within the loop :

A random number is generated by the node ['RAND'](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py) and multiplied with a constant defined by the user with the node [`CONSTANT`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py). Finally the result is displayed with the visualization node [`BIG_NUMBER`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/VISUALIZERS/PLOTLY/BIG_NUMBER/BIG_NUMBER.py) and updated during each iteration of the loop.

After each iteration, the [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node checks if the remaining number of iterations is greater than zero. If so, it enqueues its body nodes again until the number of remaining iterations becomes zero. Finally, it enqueues the nodes connected to its "end" output.
