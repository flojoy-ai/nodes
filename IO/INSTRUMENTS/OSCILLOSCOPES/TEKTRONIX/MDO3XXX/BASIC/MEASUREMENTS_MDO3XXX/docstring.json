  "long_description": "This node can select from three different waveform measurements:\nfrequency, period, and amplitude. Also available are 5 statistic modes:\ninstant, mean, max, min, and stdev where instant is a single measurement\nand stdev is the standard deviation of the mean.\n\nUnits are in seconds, Hz, and V for frequency, period, and amplitude respectively.\n\nRequires a CONNECTION_MDO3XXX node at the start of the app to connect with\nthe instrument. The VISA address will then be listed under 'connection'.\n\nThis node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):\nMDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.",
